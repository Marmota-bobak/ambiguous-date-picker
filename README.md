# Project name TBD

```python
python3 main.py

Input any sentence = add an event
exit = exit the program
ls = show all saved events

can automatically extract and calculate deadline of an event from input
eg. Finish my homework before next friday
The program will know that today is 2019/7/27 saturday, and next friday is 2019/8/2.
